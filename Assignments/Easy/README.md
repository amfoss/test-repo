# Beginner Java Assignment 

## Task 1 

Please do the following and send the files as a pull request - 

1. Your task will be create a POJO.
1. Define two variables of any data type. 
1. Initialize the variables through a parameterized constructor that takes in **both** the variables.
1. Create ```getter and setters``` for the two variables.
1. Override the ```toString()``` method of this class. 

:sparkles: ```Bonus :``` Create a new class with a ```main()``` method, create objects of the above class and print the objects on the console.    

## Task 2

Your task will be to simulate a **Grocery shop**. 

1.  Create a ```Fruit``` class and two subclasses of the ```Fruit``` class.
    1. The ```Fruit``` class should contain the following variables -
        1. fruitName of type ```String```
        1. price of type ```float```
    1. Create a parameterized constructor which takes in both the variables and then also a default non-parameterized constructor. 
    1. Override the ```toString()``` method.
    1. Create getters and setters for all the variables. 
1.  Create a ```Vegetable``` class and two subclasses of the ```Vegetable``` class. 
    1. The ```Vegetable``` class should contain the following variables -
        1. vegetableName of type ```String```
        1. price of type ```float```
    1. Create a parameterized constructor which takes in both the variables and then also a default non-parameterized constructor. 
    1. Override the ```toString()``` method.
    1. Create getters and setters for all the variables. 
1.  Create a ```FruitAndVeggeShop``` class which contains the following variables - 
    1. ArrayList<Fruit>
    1. ArrayList<Vegetable>
1.  Create a parameterized constructor that takes in both the ArrayList's as arguments.
1.  Create a method which prints all the fruits present in the ArrayList.
1.  Create a method which prints all the vegetables present in the ArrayList.

:sparkles: **Bonus:** Print all the fruits present in the ArrayList using the forEach() method by making use of a method reference.
